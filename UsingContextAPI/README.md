# UsingRedux Todo Application

Welcome to the UsingRedux Todo Application. This is a simple, yet powerful Todo application built with Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript applications.

## About

The `UsingContextAPI` subfolder contains our Todo application. The Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. This makes our Todo application more manageable and efficient.

In this application, you can add, delete, and toggle todos. The state of the application is managed using contextAPI.
